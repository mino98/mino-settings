# Configs and stuff for my daily routine
Feel free to plagiarize anything you find in here:
- my `.tmux.conf`, which is very basic except: 
  - setting `TERM` so that Bash `PS1` coloring works
  - enabling mouse, because we're in 2017
  - avoid renaming windows automagically, because... why would you want to do that?
  - styling the status bar with only the session/window name and current time
  - changing the color theme
  
- my `.vimrc`, which I inherited from [tent](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tentator/?ppe=1) around 2002 and have carried around since then. It could probably benefit from a makeover, I just noticed there's a reference to `/mnt/floppy` :)

- my `.bashrc`, with just a handful of shortcuts. 

## Other stuff I use daily
Terminal work involves:
- [iTerm2](https://www.iterm2.com)
- [RMATE](https://github.com/aurora/rmate)
- [HomeBrew](https://brew.sh/)
- [Tunnelblick](https://tunnelblick.net/)
